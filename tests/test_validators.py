"""Unit tests for RequestValidator's DP-divisibility contract.

The load-bearing case: an indivisible batch must be REJECTED, not attempted,
and not waivable by ALLOW_PARTIAL_BATCHES. Miles derives num_steps_per_rollout
per rank from that rank's local sample count, so an unbalanced split gives the
ranks different micro-step counts and they deadlock on the gradient collective
-- the future never resolves and the actors stay wedged until restart.
Measured 2026-08-04 with 3 samples at dp=2; see
specs/008-q3-abstraction-tax/HANDOFF.md.

The flag still governs the genuinely partial cases (RL group alignment), where
the consequence is normalization rather than liveness.
